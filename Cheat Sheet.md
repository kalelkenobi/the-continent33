## Paragraphs

These are **two** paragraphs (technically **three**, if you count this one):

I really like using Markdown.
  
I think I'll use it to format all of my documents from now on.

This is a list with an embedded paragraph:
* This is the first list item.
* Here's the second list item.

	I need to add another paragraph below the second list item.

* And here's the third list item.

## Line Breaks

To create a line break (`<br>`), end a line with two or more spaces, and then type return.
This is the first line.  
And this is the second line.

## Emphasis

You can add emphasis by making text bold or italic.

### Bold

I just love **bold text**.

### Italic

Italicized text is the *cat's meow*.

### Bold and Italic

This text is ***really important***.
